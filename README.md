# Piano Play

I am delighted to share that I designed and developed a piano-focused website that caters to the needs of music enthusiasts and beginners alike. The website has an extensive library of keynotes, ranging from :

*  #C
* #Db
* #D
* #Eb
* #E
* #F
* #Gb
* #G
* #Ab
*  #A
* #B

that are designed to help users learn and practice at their own pace. 

Whether you are a seasoned pianist or someone who is just starting, the website is perfect for you. You can choose your favorite keynote and start playing beautiful music in no time. Additionally, the website also offers a recording feature that lets you save your performance and share it with others.

I take great pride in the website and hope that it will inspire piano enthusiasts to hone their skills and create beautiful music.
